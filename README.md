# AirBnB-listings
A Look Into Home Availability, Pricing and Reviews

## Motivation
For this project, I wanted to look deep into AirBnB datasets for Lyon and Bordeaux (France). I will be focusing on answering these questions below in the jupyter notebook and there (https://medium.com/@vally.selvarasa/airbnb-in-france-lyon-vs-bordeaux-616315f8d2ec). 

- How are the availability and the pricing of the properties in both cities throughout the year?
- Who visit more each of the cities ?
- How does the pricing increase or decrease by neighborhood in Lyon ?
- How well can we predict an Airbnbâ€™s price? Which variables are important in the prediction?

## Installation
The libraries we will be using will be:
Python 3.7.3 Anaconda Distribution

[folium] (https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/)

[langdetect] (https://pypi.org/project/langdetect/)

## File Descriptions
* `calendar_Lyon.csv` and `calendar_Bordeaux.csv` - csv containing **availability**, and **price** for every listing/date combination
